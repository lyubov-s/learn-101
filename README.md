## DevOps vs Agile

Agile and DevOps both prioritize collaboration, continuous improvement, and delivering working software. They can be used together to create a more efficient software development process. Agile emphasizes iterative development and customer satisfaction, while DevOps emphasizes automating processes and integrating development and operations teams. When used together, Agile and DevOps can improve software development and delivery by streamlining processes and enhancing collaboration.

DevOps is a mindset and set of practices, not a specific job title. Anyone involved in the software development and delivery process can adopt a DevOps mindset and apply DevOps practices in their work, including developers, QA engineers, operations engineers and others.
